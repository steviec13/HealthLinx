			<strong class="termsPrivacyTitle">Privacy Notice</strong>
			<p>March 2016</p>
			<strong>OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY</strong>
			<p>HealthLinx Executive Search, Inc. ("HealthLinxÂ®") has developed this Privacy Notice ("Notice") to explain our online information practices as they relate to information submitted through this HealthLinx website (the "Site"). This Notice is effective from the time it is posted on the Site, as noted above. To make this Notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and on every page through which personally identifiable information may be submitted.</p>

			<strong>TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW IT IS USED</strong>

			<p>With respect to personally identifying information, HealthLinx collects and retains only information that you voluntarily submit to us. Non-personal information can include information that has been de-identified; that is, information that has been rendered anonymous. We automatically collect certain non-personal information from you when you access our Site. This information can include, among other things, IP addresses, the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, etc.), the third party website from which your visit originated, the operating system you are using (e.g., Vista, Windows XP, Mac OS, etc.), the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, NetZero, etc.), the search terms you use on our Site, the specific web pages you visit, and the duration of your visits.</p>

			<p>We use non-personal information in a variety of ways, including to help analyze site traffic, understand customer needs and trends, carry out targeted promotional activities, and to improve our service offerings. We may use your non-personal information by itself or aggregate it with information we have obtained from other users. We may share your non-personally identifying, anonymous information with our affiliated companies and third party service providers to achieve these objectives and others.</p>

			<p>IP Addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Internet. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address, and when visitors request pages from our Site, our servers typically log their IP addresses. We collect IP addresses for purposes of system administration, to report non-personal aggregate information to others, and to track the use of our Site. It is not our practice to link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable; that is, the visitor's session will be logged, but the visitor remains anonymous to us.</p>

			<p>Cookies, etc. "Cookies" are small text files from a website that are stored on your hard drive. These text files make using our Site more convenient by, among other things, saving your passwords and preferences for you. Cookies themselves do not typically contain any personally identifiable information. We may analyze the information derived from these cookies and other technological tools we employ (such as clear gifs/web beacons) and match this information with data provided by you or another party. We may provide our analysis and certain non-personal information to third parties (who may in turn use this information to provide tailored advertisements on the Site), but this will not involve disclosing any of your personally identifiable information.</p>

			<p>If you are concerned about the storage and use of cookies, you may be able to direct your internet browser to notify you and seek approval whenever a cookie is being sent to your hard drive. You may also delete a cookie manually from your hard drive through your internet browser or other programs. Please note, however, that some parts of our Site will not function properly or be available to you if you refuse to accept a cookie or choose to disable the acceptance of cookies.</p>

			<strong>Disclosure Required</strong>
			<p>HealthLinx reserves the right to disclose any information you have submitted, without notice, if required to do so by law or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) conform to the requirements of the law or to comply with legal process served on HealthLinx or the Site;</li>
				<li>(b) protect and defend the rights or property of HealthLinx; or,</li>
				<li>(c) protect the personal safety of HealthLinx employees, associates, consumers, or the public.</li>
			</ul>
			 
			<strong>OTHER INFORMATION COLLECTED</strong>
			<strong>Third Party Material or Links</strong>
			<p>We may from time to time contract or partner with advertisers or other third parties who place information, advertisements, or other material or links on our Site. If you click on a link and leave our Site, you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties. We do not have responsibility for, or access to, the information collected by such third parties. Any links from this Site to the website of a third party are not necessarily endorsements, sponsorships, or recommendations of the ideas, products, or services of the third party. HealthLinx is not liable for any damages, including indirect, incidental, special, or consequential, resulting from the use of third party websites.</p>

			<p>Google Analytics is a web analysis service provided by Google. Google utilizes the data collected to track and examine the use of healthlinx.com, to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other Google services. We have implemented the Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting feature to better understand site traffic and customer behavior.</p>

			<p>We use Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting to better understand site traffic and customer behavior. We do not serve ads on site, and Google may use the data collected to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. Visitors are able to opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the Ads Settings.</p>

			<p>Public Forums/User Generated Content. We may offer message boards, bulletin boards, or similar public forums where users of our Site can communicate or post photographic or other content. The protections described in this Privacy Notice do not apply if you provide information (including personal information) in connection with your use of these public forums. Any information you share in a public forum is public information and we are not responsible for events arising from the distribution of any information you choose to publicly post or share through our Site.</p>

			<strong>Information of Others</strong>
			<p>If you choose to submit the information of someone other than yourself without HealthLinx's knowledge, the information will be handled in accordance with this Notice. You, however, are solely responsible and liable for any claims relating to your submission and use of that information.</p>

			<strong>CHILDREN</strong>
			<p>The features, programs, promotions and other aspects of our Site requiring the submission of personally identifiable information are not intended for children. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 and believe he or she has disclosed personally identifiable information to us please contact us as provided in this Notice. A parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 may review and request deletion of such child's personally identifiable information as well as prohibit the use thereof.</p>

			<strong>OUR COMMITMENT TO DATA SECURITY</strong>
			<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. None of the personal data collected is stored directly in the Site pages. We have further measures in place to protect your personal information once it reaches us.</p>

			<strong>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY NOTICE</strong>
			<p>We reserve the right to change our Privacy Notice from time to time. If we make any substantial changes, we will notify you by displaying a new posting date at the top of our Privacy Notice.</p>

			<strong>HOW TO CONTACT US</strong>

			<strong>SOLE STATEMENT</strong>
			<p>This Privacy Notice as posted on this Site is the sole statement of our privacy practices with respect to this Site, and no summary, modification, restatement or other version thereof, or other privacy statement or notice, in any form, is valid unless we post a new or revised notice to the Site.</p>
