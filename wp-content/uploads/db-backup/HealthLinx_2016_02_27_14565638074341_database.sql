The first office was opened in German Village and increased company size to 9 employees.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, Julie’s husband, Matt, came on board as the CEO and quickly advanced the business further.\r\n\r\n<em>“Never thought a company could work so collaboratively with a lot of money involved.”</em>\r\n\r\nOffice moved to Front St. in 2002 and Matt Berry came on as CEO that year.\r\n\r\nMoved to Grandview in 2007.
